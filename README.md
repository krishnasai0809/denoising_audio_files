## 🎧 Audio Denoising Autoencoder with TensorFlow

This project is an Audio Denoising Application that leverages a deep learning autoencoder built with TensorFlow. The model is designed to remove noise from audio signals and enhance audio quality.

## 🔍 Key Features
- Trained a 1D Convolutional Autoencoder for audio denoising.
- Hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner for optimal performance.
- Preprocessing pipeline for audio normalization, padding/truncation, and reshaping for model input.
- Converts noisy .wav files into clean denoised versions.
- Integrated with a Flask API for easy model serving and deployment (optional).
- Supports inference pipeline with audio preprocessing, model prediction, and saving denoised audio.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python 3.9.6
- TensorFlow & Keras
- Keras Tuner
- Librosa
- SoundFile (for audio I/O)
- Flask (for deployment-ready API)
- Docker
